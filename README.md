# predictive-modeling-R
Built and evaluated regression, tree, and neural network models in R to assess AI exposure patterns across U.S. counties.

# Business Problem
The goal of this phase was to evaluate whether economic and demographic indicators at the U.S. county level could meaningfully predict AI exposure across regions.

# Dataset
The analysis uses U.S. county-level data covering over 3,000 counties, including:
- Socioeconomic indicators
- Economic and labor-related variables
- AI exposure metrics  
(Note: Raw data is not included due to academic restrictions.)

# Modeling Approach
Multiple predictive models were built and evaluated, including:
- Linear regression
- Decision tree models
- Neural networks  

# Models were compared using performance metrics to assess predictive strength and limitations.
